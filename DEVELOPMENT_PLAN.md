# Step-by-Step Development Plan
*Collaborative Implementation Guide*

## Development Approach

### Our Roles
- **You**: Requirements, testing, feedback, user story definition
- **Me**: Code implementation, architecture, debugging, documentation

### Development Workflow
1. **Plan** â†’ Discuss feature requirements
2. **Implement** â†’ I code the feature 
3. **Test** â†’ You test and provide feedback
4. **Iterate** â†’ Refine based on your input
5. **Move Next** â†’ Proceed to next feature

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-3)

### Step 1.1: Project Structure Setup
**What we'll do:**
- Create proper TypeScript project structure
- Set up development dependencies
- Configure build and test scripts

**Your role:** Review project structure, suggest modifications

### Step 1.2: Configuration System
**What we'll implement:**
```typescript
// src/config/config.ts
interface Config {
  llm: LLMConfig;
  browser: BrowserConfig;
  testing: TestConfig;
  reporting: ReportConfig;
}
```

**Your role:** Define what configuration options you need

### Step 1.3: Basic Types & Models
**What we'll create:**
```typescript
// Core data models
interface UserStory { }
interface TestCase { }
interface TestResult { }
```

**Your role:** Review types, suggest additional fields

---

## Phase 2: Local LLM Integration (Days 4-6)

### Step 2.1: LLM Client Setup
**Implementation:**
- Ollama integration
- Local model management
- Prompt template system

**Your testing:** Verify LLM responses, test different prompts

### Step 2.2: Test Case Generation
**Implementation:**
- Replace OpenAI with local LLM
- Improve prompt engineering
- Add structured output parsing

**Your testing:** Compare test case quality, provide sample user stories

### Step 2.3: User Story Parser
**Implementation:**
- Parse different formats (plain text, Gherkin, JSON)
- Extract test scenarios automatically

**Your testing:** Provide various user story formats to test

---

## Phase 3: Browser & API Discovery (Days 7-10)

### Step 3.1: Network Monitoring
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Capture all network requests during browser automation
class NetworkMonitor {
  captureRequests(page: Page): APIEndpoint[]
}
```

**Your testing:** Navigate through your target web app, verify API capture

### Step 3.2: Enhanced UI Runner
**Implementation:**
- Smart element detection
- Better error handling
- Screenshot capabilities

**Your testing:** Test on your target website, identify missing features

### Step 3.3: API Test Generation
**Implementation:**
- Generate API tests from captured requests
- Create validation logic

**Your testing:** Verify generated API tests make sense

---

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Test Runner (Days 11-14)

### Step 4.1: Hybrid Testing
**Implementation:**
- Run UI and API tests together
- Synchronize test execution
- Share state between tests

**Your testing:** Define complex user workflows to test

### Step 4.2: Test Orchestration
**Implementation:**
- Parallel execution
- Dependency management
- Smart retry logic

**Your testing:** Run large test suites, identify performance issues

### Step 4.3: Enhanced Assertions
**Implementation:**
- Custom assertion library
- Visual and API assertions

**Your testing:** Define what assertions you need most

---

## Phase 5: Reporting & Analytics (Days 15-18)

### Step 5.1: Rich Report Generator
**Implementation:**
- HTML dashboard
- PDF export
- Real-time monitoring

**Your testing:** Review report formats, suggest improvements

### Step 5.2: Test Analytics
**Implementation:**
- Execution metrics
- Trend analysis
- Coverage reporting

**Your testing:** Define what metrics matter most to you

---

## Daily Development Process

### Morning (Planning - 15 mins)
1. **You:** Define today's requirements/priorities
2. **Me:** Clarify technical approach
3. **Agree:** On specific deliverables for the day

### Afternoon (Development - 2-3 hours)
1. **Me:** Implement planned features
2. **Me:** Commit code with clear messages
3. **Me:** Document what was built

### Evening (Testing - 30 mins)
1. **You:** Test implemented features
2. **You:** Provide feedback/bug reports
3. **Both:** Plan next day's work

---

## Quality Gates

### Before Moving to Next Phase:
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code is documented
- [ ] You approve the implementation
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

---

## Communication Protocol

### When You Need Changes:
1. **Describe** what's not working
2. **Provide** specific examples
3. **Suggest** preferred behavior

### When I Need Clarification:
1. **Ask** specific questions
2. **Provide** implementation options
3. **Wait** for your decision

---

## First Week Goals
